when you compile it to job1 and execute it like ./job1 5 where 5 is 5 means this micro benchmark will run for approximately 5 seconds
you should make this job ocupy the processor for 5 seconds
and let the procssor excute  task implement in this job i.e., batch_job.

you should also consider a mechanism  to make the 5 as a argument not implemented as hard code.
